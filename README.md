Full Stack Developer Nanodegree: Project 1: Static Movie Website

This repository contains files which create a static HTML website to view a selected few movies. The goal of this creation was the learn how to write server-side code to feed data to websites using python. I would say the class was relatively easy to follow and the programming not too challenging. I still don't feel like I have written server-side code though, it just feels like I created a few Python files which open a webpage to display content (which I guess is inflated using the HTML code written in the fresh_tomatoes.py file. At any rate a good refresher, maybe the dots will join later
